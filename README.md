# Quick experiment: Impact of Context for Image Recognition
  
In [Kolmogorov's sense of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity), conditional complexity allows to take some background knowledge into account for description complexity.  
  
Can this concept be applied to image recognition?  
  
I did a quick experiment to try to highlight this process in the context of image recognition.  
  
## Reminder: Conditional Complexity
The complexity of description (called also Kolmogorov complexity) is the minimal number of information bits needed to describe a given object.  
  
With this definition, we talk about conditional complexity when we allow the use of background knowledge in the way we encode our information. The advantage of doing it this way is important: the object will be less complicated to describe using this context, and therefore of less complexity.  
  
The more information in the context, the lower the description complexity of the object. On the contrary, with fewer context, the description will be more complex.
