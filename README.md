# quick-experiment_Impact-of-Context-for-Image-Recognition
In Kolmogorov's sense of complexity, conditional complexity allows to take some background knowledge into account for description complexity. Can this concept be applied to image recognition? I did a quick experiment to try to highlight this process in the context of image recognition.
