# Quick experiment: Impact of Context for Image Recognition
  
In [Kolmogorov's sense of complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity), conditional complexity allows to take some background knowledge into account for description complexity. Can this concept be applied to image recognition? I did a quick experiment to try to highlight this process in the context of image recognition.
